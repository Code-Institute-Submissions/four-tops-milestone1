-----------------

### What is it for?
This website, designed especially for the band **THE FOUR TOPS**, will give you an overview of their past, present, and future.

### What is available?
The homepage will act as a simple display screen with navigation tools at the top of the page for linking the other pages. The logo (which always is top center of the page( acts as a quick link back to the home page)
Following on you will have the about section describing the artists and their role, this includes a photo on devices other than mobile.
On the events page you will be able to contact the band using a simple for allowing them to perform at your venue of choice, also you can follow the links provided and book the upcoming tours that are detailed with location and date on the page through an external website.
The final page allows users to listen and watch different songs from their career. A simple photo carousel with pictures will continue to cycle, embedded Spotify links in the middle of the page and finally embedded Youtube links to videos. These links all allow playing in the browser or you can go to their retrospective sites for more.
On all pages (bar the events area) you will see the alert box above the footer with a pop up modal allowing you to contact the band from any page with a simple box.
Don't forget to follow the 3 social media links to their Facebook, Twitter and Youtube accounts.

UX
--
This website will act as a good source of information for anyone of any age. 
You will be able to view tours that are coming up giving you the ability to book tickets to a specific tour. 
There are a selection of photos available throughout the page that best describe the band and their genre. Along with this music and music videos that can be played straight from the browser. 
Through alerts, modal boxes and forms scattered across each page you will easily be able to contact the group if this is what you would like.
In all the website give you access to the bands profiles, their music they make and where you can go to see them live. We then add the ability to contact the group for a more direct approach from companies and venues.

 - As a member of the public who do not know the band, this allows me to listen to their most famous music to see if i like what they produce.
 - As a returning fan they have music from their greatest albums, the ability to watch their music videos and also book upcoming tour dates.
 - From the business side - I am able to contact the band on an either social aspect or business venture through the form. Also you can see when they are next playing to get a feel for how they are live.
The page in all allows you too see who they are, what type of music they deliver to their fans and also where and when they will be playing next
